 <h2>About Me</h2>  
 <p>Hello! I'm Fransisca, an undergraduate student majoring in Information Systems at Gunadarma University. I have a strong passion for front-end web development, particularly in creating responsive, user-friendly, and visually attractive interfaces. I enjoy turning ideas into digital experiences that not only function well but also look engaging and modern.
   consider myself a responsible and detail-oriented individual. Iâ€™m used to completing tasks on time, and I have a good memory which helps me stay organized and assist others effectively. I'm eager to continue learning, exploring new technologies, and growing into a skilled front-end developer who can contribute meaningfully to the digital world.</p>
